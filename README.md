# Image-Classification
This repository contains a colab notebook with workings of an Image classification problem using Convolution Neural Networks

## Title
Lung Image classification using Tensorflow

## Author
Terry Migwi

## Project Description

The main objective of this study is to build a model that can classify a lung that has been infected with Tuberculosis and a normal lung using images of chest x-rays. The images have been loaded from google colab, some Exploratory Data Analysis performed to find out the distribution of the images, data pre-processing was conducted and Modelling using Convolution Neural Networks. Model Optimization has been performed to obtain better results.
